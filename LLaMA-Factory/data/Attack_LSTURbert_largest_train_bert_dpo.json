Slightly earlier in the evening, Delylah Meeker was driving to the hardware store with her boyfriend when they also witnessed the fire grow and spread. \"It got from campfire size to an acre in a couple of minutes, it was a really fast spread,\" Delylah told Storyful. Moments before she began recording, Delylah called the local fire department and they informed her that she was the first call they had received about the incident, but that they would be sure to act quickly.
